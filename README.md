# Reasons of Conflict

1. **Differing Job Responsibilities:** As the CFO, Damon is responsible for financial management and ensuring the company's financial health. On the other hand, Ahmed, as the Head of Sales, focuses on generating revenue through sales. Their differing priorities and responsibilities can lead to conflicts over resource allocation, budgeting decisions, and sales strategies.
    
2. **Competing Objectives:** Damon's focus on financial stability may sometimes clash with Ahmed's sales-driven objectives. For example, Damon may be cautious about budgetary expenditures or pricing strategies that could impact profitability, while Ahmed may prioritize aggressive sales tactics or investment in marketing to boost revenue.
    
3. **Communication Issues:** The case study suggests that there may be communication issues between Damon and Ahmed, as evidenced by their 360-degree reviews and the confrontations mentioned in the text. Poor communication can exacerbate conflicts and hinder effective collaboration between departments.
    
4. **Personality Differences:** The case study describes Damon as brilliant but not warm, while Ahmed's comments about Damon being a "control freak" indicate a perception of micromanagement or rigid behavior. Personality differences and clashes in working styles can contribute to interpersonal conflicts within teams.
